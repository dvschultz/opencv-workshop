# Installation Prerequisites

## Anaconda

Anaconda allows us to run Python in an isolated environment. This is particularly important on Macs where there a bunch of different Python versions already running.

1. Go the [Anaconda Downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) page. Click on the graphical installer for your OS.
2. Install the software as you usually do on your OS.
3. Once installed, open up Terminal (on Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (on Windows)
4. In the command line interface, type `conda create --name opencv python=3.7`. When prompted, you can type `y` plus Enter to install the necessary software.
5. Once installed, you can type `conda activate opencv` to activate your environment. Note: you will need to run `conda activate opencv` every time you open your command line prompt or a new window.
